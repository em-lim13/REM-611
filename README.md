# REM-601
Analyses for REM 601
Here I have code for everything I did in REM 611!
The two group projects are in individual folders, each folder contains everything you need to run the code
If you're new to github, but want to look at the R files, you can just open those up and take a peak!
If you're a github pro, you can pull EVERYTHING from this project onto your computer and play with it yourself
If you want to learn to do that, I have a word doc titled "Github Tutorial" in the main REM-611 folder that will tell you how to do that
I only ask that you please don't commit any changes to the project!
