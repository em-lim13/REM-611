# REM-601

Here I have code for everything I did in REM 611! 
The two group projects are in individual folders, each folder contains everything you need to run the code. 
If you're new to github, but want to look at the R files, you can just open those up and take a peak!
If you're a github pro, you can pull EVERYTHING from this project onto your computer and play with it yourself, just please don't commit any changes. 
If you want to learn to put this project on your computer and play with it, I have a word doc titled "Github Tutorial" in the main REM-611 folder that will tell you how to do that! Please email me at em_lim@sfu.ca if you have any questions!
